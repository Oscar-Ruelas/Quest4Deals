## Contributing
- Document the code well so others can understand it
- Create a pull request for every branch merge, so someone else can review and approve it
- Adhere to [git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
- When a branch is merged, delete it so we don't clutter the branches
